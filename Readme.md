# Specification
Let me tell you at first, that input and result are not specifically mentioned in the guideline, it contains also another zip file containing kml and python distance function that I did not knew the relation.

#Work

I have genrated the core of haptree algorithm, the hapcut, that optimizes MEC score based on computing max-cut  of the fragment graph. I need in a next step to set up up the heuristic clustering functionand a "spanningtree"to minimize fragments conflicts. These two operations can only be done based on data generated with the hapcut algorithm that is available on this repository.
